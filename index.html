			<h2>Yo-Yo as an Art Form</h2>
			<p>Art is many things to many people: Beauty, creativity, self-expression, passion, and much more.</p>
			<p>
				Merriam-Webster defines art as:
				<blockquote>
					"Something that is created with imagination and skill and that is beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings"
				</blockquote>
				Yo-Yos may not be the first thing to come to mind, but to many, yo-yos are beauty, creativity, self-expression, passion, and much more. The tricks and combos we perform are things "created with imagination and skill" and can express many "important ideas or feelings." Yo-Yo can be a performance art, a form of self-reflection and meditation, a competitive skill, and a creative outlet.
